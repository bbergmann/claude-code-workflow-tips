## 💡 Key Workflow Tips

### General Workflow
- **Start with Plan Mode:** "I sit, I ask CC what to do (in plan mode), I review and refine the plan and I ask CC to implement."
- **Break Down Tasks:** "I feed it small tasks at a time, not full features." Feed Claude Code small, manageable tasks rather than large features to ensure higher quality output.
- **Use CLAUDE.md:** "Claude reads it automatically on every session. Put your conventions, gotchas, and architecture decisions there." This file is crucial for maintaining context and consistency across sessions.

### Context Management
- **Wrap Up and Catch Up:** "So instead of /compact: /wrapup saves what matters, /clear, then /catchup picks it up." Use these commands to manage context effectively.
- **Keep Context Utilization Low:** "One non-obvious trick: keep context utilization below ~50%." Aim to keep the context window below 50% to avoid performance issues.

### Advanced Techniques
- **Custom Skills:** "Custom skills in ~/.claude/commands have been the biggest unlock for me." Create custom skills to automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency.
- **Parallel Sessions:** "I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal." Run multiple Claude Code instances using tools like tmux or Git worktrees.

### Project Management
- **Use Specific Tools:** "I'm using https://github.com/cowwoc/claude-code-cat/ at the moment for solo dev work." Integrate Claude Code with project management tools for a comprehensive workflow.
- **Markdown-Based Documentation:** "I'd recommend going all in on markdown." Use Markdown for detailed documentation and architectural decisions.
