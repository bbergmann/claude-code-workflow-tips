You're about to master the workflows that separate casual users from Claude Code power users.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- 🚀 **10x Productivity:** Do in minutes what takes hours.\n- 🧠 **Consistent Quality:** Same great results every session.\n- ⚡ **Flow State:** Less friction, more building.\n\n**The Plan:** 9 levels, about 15 mins total.
